## About this Notice

This Cookie Notice ("Notice") explains how we use cookies and other similar technologies to recognise you when you visit our websites tokenizer.ca, cscexams.ca, bambarbia.com ("Website") or when you use our mobile application ("App"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

Please take the time to read this Notice carefully. If you have any questions or comments, please contact us via email at privacy@tokenizer.ca.

## What are cookies?

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website or use a mobile application. Cookies are widely used by website or mobile application owners in order to make their websites or mobile applications work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.

Cookies have many different features, such as allowing you to navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving your user experience. They can also help ensure that the advertisements you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.

Cookies set by the website or app owner (in this case, Tokenizer) are called "first party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website or app owner are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or mobile application (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer or mobile device both when it visits the websites or uses the mobile application in question and also when it visits certain other websites.

## How long do cookies last?
Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. Some cookies are 'session cookies', which means they only exist when your browser is open and are automatically deleted when you close your browser or quit the app. Other cookies are 'persistent cookies', meaning they survive after your browser or app is closed and can be used by websites or apps to recognize your computer when you re-open your browser or app later. The length of the cookies used on our Website or our App is explained in more detail in the link provided below.

## How can I control cookies?

You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject specific cookies. You can exercise your cookie preferences through your browser settings.

You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse some cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Website or our App though your access to some functionality and areas of our Website or App may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for more information.

In addition, most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of targeted advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.
