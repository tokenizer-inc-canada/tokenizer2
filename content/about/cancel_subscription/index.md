# How to Cancel Your Tokenizer Subscription: A Simple Guide

The steps you take to cancel auto-renew for your subscription depend on the platform you used to subscribe: our website, iOS, or Android app.

**Important:** If you subscribed in **Google Play** or in the **Apple Store**, please scroll down this page and find the respective instruction on how to cancel the subscription on your platform.


## Website

We have not implemented this feature yet: you cannot subscribe, and you cannot cancel subscription, via website yet. We will provide this feature and screenshots at a later date.

## iOS App

Developers are technically unable to cancel Apple iTunes subscriptions. Use this official ["If you want to cancel a subscription from Apple"](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202039) article to cancel. Ensure you're logged in with the correct Apple ID.

## Android App

Since Android payments are handled by Google Play, send a cancellation request directly to Google Support. Use this official ["Cancel, pause, or change a subscription on Google Play"](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481) article to guide you through the process. Ensure you're logged in with the Google Play account used for the subscription.
